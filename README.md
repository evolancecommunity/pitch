# Evolance - The AI Platform for Self-Reflection & Self-Awareness

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Evolance** is the AI platform for **self-reflection and self-awareness** that helps people build emotional intelligence before crisis strikes. This React TypeScript application serves as a landing page and pitch deck for the startup, showcasing their approach to emotional wellness through AI-powered self-reflection tools.

The platform addresses the **self-awareness crisis**:
- **95%** of people believe they are self-aware — but only **10–15% actually are**
- **58% of job success** is driven by emotional intelligence
- People with higher emotional intelligence earn **$29,000 more annually** on average
- Yet there are **no tools** to build true self-awareness

Evolance fills this void by helping individuals:
- **Build emotional strength before crisis** (preventive vs reactive)
- **Map root causes and emotion triggers** (vs surface-level journaling)
- **Engage in everyday self-reflection** (vs only therapy sessions)
- **Focus on inner alignment** (vs productivity hacks)
